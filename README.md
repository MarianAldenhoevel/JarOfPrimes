The Jar of Primes is a knock-off version of the Primer, a kinetic sculpture by Karl Lautman. For the original see:

Mine is built around a NodeMCU board which in turn contains a ESP8266 12E chip. To that it adds a pushbutton to command the next number and a counter to display it. The code is written in the Arduino IDE.
